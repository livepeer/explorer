![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/yarn-%3E%3D1.22.0-blue)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js 20.x](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (includes npm)
- [Yarn v1.22.x](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - enabling corepack should be sufficient

> [!TIP]
> Use `nvm install` or `asdf install` to automatically switch to the correct versions.

## Getting Started

To run the Livepeer Explorer application, follow these steps to set up your environment correctly. This involves installing Yarn, installing dependencies, and configuring environment variables.

### Install Runtime Dependencies

With Yarn installed, navigate to the root directory of the project and install all runtime dependencies using:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Setup Environment Variables

Before running the application, you must configure your environment variables:

1. **Rename the Example Environment File:**

   Rename the `.env.example` file in the root of the project to `.env`.

2. **Update Environment Variables:**

   Open the `.env` file and update the necessary environment variables. For a reference of key settings, see the [Key Environment Variables](#key-environment-variables) section below.

### Run the Explorer Application

#### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, which enables hot-reloading (automatic server restarts upon code changes), use the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the application and deploy changes to your browser without needing to restart the server manually.

#### Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application:**

   Compile and optimize the application for production by running:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Start the Production Server:**

   After building, start the application in production mode with:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Developing on Arbitrum Rinkeby

To develop on the Arbitrum Rinkeby network, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` variable to `ARBITRUM_RINKEBY` in your `.env` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=ARBITRUM_RINKEBY
```

## Testing LIPs

To test Livepeer Improvement Proposals (LIPs), follow these steps:

1. **Set the GitHub Namespace:**

   In your `.env` file, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_LIP_NAMESPACE` variable to your GitHub username:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_LIP_NAMESPACE=your_github_username
   ```

2. **Fork the LIPs Repository:**

   Fork the [LIPs repository](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs) to your GitHub account.

3. **Use Your Fork for Local Testing:**

   With the namespace and your forked repository, you can now test LIPs locally within the application.
