# Maintainers

This document describes who maintains this project and how maintenance decisions are made.

## Current Maintainers

- @ecwireless
- @Jipperism
- @rickstaa

## Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Maintaining overall code quality and project direction
- Managing releases and versioning
- Triaging issues and feature requests
- Ensuring CI and core workflows remain healthy

## Project Planning & Tracking

Active work, priorities, and longer-term plans are tracked on the maintenance project board:

👉 **Project Board:** https://github.com/orgs/livepeer/projects/18

The board is the source of truth for:

- Planned work and priorities
- In-progress tasks
- Known issues and follow-ups

Not all work is guaranteed to be scheduled, but the board reflects current focus.

## Pull Request Review

- All PRs require at least one maintainer review before merging
- Larger changes should include appropriate tests and documentation where applicable
- Larger features require oversight from appropriate stakeholders (such as the Livepeer Foundation)
- Breaking changes should be clearly called out in the PR description

## Decision-Making Process

Maintenance decisions are made by the maintainers, aiming for consensus whenever possible. For controversial changes or those with broad impact, maintainers discuss options in the relevant issue or pull request. If consensus cannot be reached in a reasonable time, @rickstaa has the final say. The Livepeer Foundation, or other stakeholders, may also be called upon to provide direction.

## Releases

- Releases are made on an as-needed basis
- Patch releases may be issued for critical fixes
- Breaking changes are documented clearly in GitHub release notes

## Project Status

This project is actively maintained.
